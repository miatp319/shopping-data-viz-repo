# A. Approach

The E-commerce dashboard presents a succinct overview of sales performance and customer demographics. This platform enables users to uncover detailed insights by leveraging more granular data, ultimately guiding business actions, particularly concerning sales categories, delivery, and payment.
The data can be found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/iamsouravbanerjee/customer-shopping-trends-dataset/code). 

I tried to approach the case as a data analyst, who create the dashboard, walk the stakeholders through insights and actions can be derived from it. I also want this dashboard to be more bias for action, therefore I suggest some way to improve the dataset quality to give a broader view about the performance.

# B. Main questions
Based on the data, there are 2 big questions 
## 1. What is the status of sales performance?

  How can historical data inform inventory preparation for the upcoming year, considering demand variations based on season, location, items, colors, and sizes?
  Which promotional strategies should be employed to entice customers or enhance subscriber numbers, based on Average Order Value, shipping preferences, and payment methods?
## 2. Who comprises our customer base, and what are their preferences?
  By analyzing the behaviors of distinct customer segments, tailored promotions can be crafted for each group.

# C. Enhancing the dashboard
  To attain a comprehensive view of sales activities, additional data collection is imperative for evaluating performance and identifying optimization opportunities. The collected data may include:

## 1. Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)
## 2. Salesman/channel data
  Evaluating the performance of individual sales personnel or advertising channels is crucial for understanding their impact on final sales. Funnel analysis can be employed to scrutinize advertising channel data and optimize conversion rates at each stage.
## 3. Promotion data
  Expanding the dataset to include monetary values associated with each order will enable the assessment of the promotion's value in relation to total sales.     Delving deeper into each type of promotion can yield valuable insights into customer responses.
## 4. Cost data
  Though cost analysis can be examined separately, it is noteworthy, especially for stakeholders such as Sales Managers. Understanding sales performance concerning revenue, costs, and gross profit is vital. Cost data encompass expenses related to advertising, cost of goods sold, and delivery/inventory.
